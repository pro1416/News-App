# NewsApp-Volley-
An android application that shows the latest news by implementing a news API using Volley 

#### Concepts used : `Volley for fetching data from API,ViewPager for sliding,Picasso library and Fragments.`

One needs a working internet connection to read the news.

However the news recieved is incomplete thanks to the free developer API key :satisfied:

Here are some screenshots from the app
